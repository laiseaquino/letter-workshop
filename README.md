# Letter Workshop / Oficina das Letras

"Oficina das Letras" is a Youtube channel by teacher Yone Aquino for the alphabetization of Portuguese speaking teens and adults. Fellow teachers may also use the material to teach their students.
This project aims to provide a website for the Workshop, making it easier to access classes, resources and lesson notes.
